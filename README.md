# PublicConveyorSpreadsheetSimulator
---
A public repos of a program I wrote for **Impact Automation Inc.**, with the algorithm hidden in this version. (Reason for few commits)
---
This code has gone through many changes and alterations outside of the algorithm, in order to create a more real world simulation.

This program is for a conveyor by Impact Automation for Amazon using Python and Spreadsheets, with the goal to simulate how the conveyor would behave in the real world.

The conveyor is very complicated, with multiple conveyors and each conveyor having its own speed, weight, and weight rating.
--
This program allows you to test the conveyor with little manual work, test specific scenarios, and test scenarios that would be unrealistic to test in real life. 
For example I tested how this conveyor would behave with 100,000 inputs of heavy flow. I real life this would require you to manually put ~100,000 boxes into the conveyor at a constant pace.
