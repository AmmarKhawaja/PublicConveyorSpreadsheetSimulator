### Public Conveyor Spreadsheet Simulator
---

A public repos of a program I wrote for **Impact Automation Inc.** with the algorithm hidden in this version.

---

This program is for a conveyor by Impact Automation for Amazon, with the goal of simulating how the conveyor would behave in the real world using Python and Spreadsheet. 

This code has gone through many changes and alterations outside of the algorithm and not seen in this repos, in order to create a more real world simulation.

It's a complicated system, with multiple conveyors and each conveyor having its own speed, weight, weight rating, and speeds being altered depending on the other factors. 

---

This program allows you to test the conveyor with little manual work, test specific scenarios, and test scenarios that would be unrealistic to test in real life. 

For example it took me a few minutes to test how the conveyor would behave with 100,000 inputs of heavy flow. I real life this would require you to manually put ~100,000 boxes into the conveyor at a constant pace, which is unrealistic except in production. But obviously you don't want to test code in production.
