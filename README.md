# PublicConveyorSpreadsheetSimulator

A public repos of a program I wrote for Impact Automation, with the algorithm hidden in this version. (Reason for few commits)

# This program simulates a conveyor by Impact Automation for Amazon using Python and Spreadsheets.

# The conveyor is very complicated, with multiple conveyors and each conveyor having its own speed, weight, and weight rating.

# The goal of this program is to simulate how the conveyor would work in the real world.

# Example in the ./scenarios folder.
