# PublicConveyorSpreadsheetSimulator

<p>A public repos of a program I wrote for **Impact Automation Inc.**, with the algorithm hidden in this version. (Reason for few commits)</p>

### This code has gone through many changes and alterations outside of the algorithm, in order to create a more real world simulation.

### This program simulates a conveyor by Impact Automation for Amazon using Python and Spreadsheets.

### The conveyor is very complicated, with multiple conveyors and each conveyor having its own speed, weight, and weight rating.

### The goal of this program is to simulate how the conveyor would work in the real world.

### **Example in the ./scenarios folder.**
